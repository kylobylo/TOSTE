# TOSTE
TOSTE: Totally Open Source Tile Editor.  An SFML-based C++ Tile Editor which writes tilemaps to a binary file.

This is a very early version of the tile editor and is mostly unusable without changing some code.  You can save load and new your map with the UI but the background feature does not work and you currently do not have an option to change which file you save to or which file you read the tilePallet from.  You can make your own tilePallet by saving a png as fakeTilePallet.png in the Graphics folder.  It must be 640x640 and 16x16 pixels per-tile.  The first tile must be transparent.
